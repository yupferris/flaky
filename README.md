# flaky

A super simple Pebble watch app for dbfinteractive's [Weather Challenge 2015](http://www.dbfinteractive.com/forum/index.php?topic=6364). Also a nice experiment in writing Pebble watch apps in Rust. Based on my [RustyPebble fork](https://github.com/yupferris/RustyPebble).

## NOTE

I started this around 3 hours before the deadline, and very much failed to make it, so this project isn't complete :) I might finish it one of these days, might not. In any case I'll probably try to do the whole thing again from C instead of Rust, then port once it works. I very much underestimated how much of a pain it is to try to use Rust without the standard lib atm :) This code does build, tho!
